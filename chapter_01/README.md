Unit test and independent class implementation of the poly_horner function,
plus correct credits.

Use pytest for unit testing.

Agenda:
* Add polynomal class (using Horner scheme)
* Add polynomal least square fit class
* Add unit tests for both cases
* Add unit test to check that the polynomial least squares with reg 
is identical to the polynomial least squares without reg when lambda = 0
